## Follow these instructions to have the best experience:

### 1 - Setting up the GitHub Repo:

To begin working on your own repository, the first step is to remove the .git folder `rm -rf .git`.
Then, create a new repository on GitHub and initialize it by running the command `git init` in your local project directory.
Add all files to the staging area using `git add .` and create your first commit with `git commit -m 'My first commit'`.
After completing these steps, you can add the remote origin to your repository by running `git remote add origin 'link of your repository'`.
Finally, push your first commit to the remote origin with `git push origin master`.

### 2 - Working on the project:

The project is located on the `./src` directory and all the necessary assets can be found on the
`./src/assets` directory.
